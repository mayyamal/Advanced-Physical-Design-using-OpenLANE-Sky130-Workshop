# Advanced-Physical-Design-using-OpenLANE-Sky130-Workshop



The goal of openLANE is to produce a clean GDSII layout with no human intervention. OpenLANE already includes large number of design examples.
OpenLANE is based on several open-source projects: openROAD, Yosys, ABC, KLayout, Fault, QFlow, Magic.

Fully automated open-source end-to-end ASIC design flow

## Day 1 Inception of open-source EDA, openLANE and SkyWater 130

- From `â€Œ/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane` we should start docker and execute the following commands:

- In this workshop we are using the **picorv32a** design:

- In `config.tcl` as well as in `sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl` I changed the `CLOCK_PERIOD` as show in the lab videos:
 - `config.tcl`. The variables used in this files are described in Day 2 and can be found in the `/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/configuration/README.md` file.

 - `sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl`:<br/>

- Afterwards we prep the design:

- In `/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a` a `runs` folder is created:

- The merged LEF files are found in the `merged.lef`. It contains information about the technology and the cells in the SCL. This is an example of a DFF cell:

- Finally we run the **synthesis** using `run_synthesis`: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57360760/182968222-db42351d-3ffa-430c-a4a2-2638289b1672.png)


- The flip flop ratio in my synthesized design is 10.8% (i.e., 1613/14876), where 1613 is the number of DFFs (`sky130_fd_sc_hd__dfxtp_2`) and 14876 is the total number of cells: <br/>

- The synthesized netlist is in `/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/<run>/results/synthesis`:

- The reports are in `/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/<run>/reports/synthesis`. In `1_yosys_4.stat.rpt` we can observe the same numbers shown above after synthesys:

 :question: MM I do not have the timing report he had in the video after synthesis



Synthesis (using yosys) converts the picorv32a RTL to a gate-level netlist using the skywater??? standard cell library (SCL)


## Day 2 Good floorplan vs bad floorplan and introduction to library cells

As described in Day1 there are several floorplans: chip floor-planning, macro floor-planning, power planning

- The next step after synthesis is **floorplan**. Before running the floorplan, we need to do some congiguration :question: MM- elaborate

 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57360760/183244330-a67fe66a-caa5-45e9-b809-0f9f8f2717b0.png)
 
 - The `README` file shows all the variables/switches required at different stages of the desing flow (e.g., `FP_CORE_UTIL` - the core utilization percentage; `FP_ASPECT_RATIO`  - the core's aspect ratio (height / width). This variables are set with their defaults in the `.tcl` files in the same directory (this files have the lowest precedence). For the chosen design (e.g., picorv32a), as mentioned in Day 1, they are set in the `config.tcl` and `sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl` files  in the `/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a` directory. The `sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl` has the highest precedence.

- The new content of `config.tcl` is <br/>

- The new content of `sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl` is <br/>

- Since the values in `sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl` have higher precedence, the current values of this varibales after `run_floorplan` are: <br/>

## Day 3 Design library cell using Magic Layout and ngspice characterization

As described in Day1 standard cells have a reular layout.


## Day 4 Pre-layout timing analysis and importance of good clock tree


## Day 5 Final steps for RTL2GDS using tritonRoute and openSTA

Timing verification: Static Timing Analysis (STA) ensures that all timing constraints are met, and that the circuit runs at the designated clock frequency.
